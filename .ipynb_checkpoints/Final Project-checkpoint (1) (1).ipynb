    "# Introduction\n",

    "Vancouver is reported to be the least affordable housing market in North America (Grigoryeva & Ley, 2019). Fluctuated with the health of the economy, housing prices are based on a variety of factors, such as size of the property and the installation status of amenities. However, there should always be things about a home that intrinsically make it higher value than others. \n",
    "**Removing economic fluctuations, what makes a house worth more than another, and how can we predict the value of a house?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Goal*: Predict housing prices based on its size, with consideration of additional attributes (bedrooms, bathroom, stories, and parking).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, we will be using the Housing Price Prediction dataset from Kaggle. This comprehensive data set includes 13 key attributes of residential properties, covering property size, architectural features, the presence of amenities, and infrastructures within the house. Our focus will be on the quantitative variables, such as areas, bedrooms, bathroom, stories, and parking. Analyzing these non-economic factors provides deeper insight into their influence on price predictions, potentially helping future homebuyers in budget planning.\n"

    "\n",
    "We will assess both KNN and linear regression models to determine the most accurate one. Both of the regression models predict the price of the homes given their predictor variables, the main one being the area of the home, in order to find the model which will yield the most accurate result given the data provided.  As is standard in the creation of a model, the dataset is initially split into a training and testing data frame.  The ideal number of nearest neighbours will need to be tuned for the KNN algorithm, and only afterwards will we fit the model onto our training set and predict its accuracy while comparing the predicted values of the predicted variables, and the original variables of the test set. \n",

The research indicates that the square footage of a property exerts the most significant impact on housing price, closely followed by its location, and its number of bathrooms and bedrooms (Jafari & Akhavian, 2019). Remarkably, our findings align closely with these established research conclusions. Moreover, the study indicates that neighborhood characteristics, such as distance to open spaces and shopping malls, exert a comparatively weaker influence on housing prices. This conclusion further justified our effective choices of variables."

    "With this model, we can more accurately predict unknown housing prices and find out if listed houses are either undervalued or overvalued. This can be helpful to both sellers and buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For sellers*, this model can act as a benchmark for what price to list a house at. Even in the presence of a realtor, the model can act as a second opinion and give sellers additional peace of mind if both the realtor and model agree on a fair price. \n",
    "\n",
    "*For buyers*, this model can help screen for good deals. If one is looking for a house with three bedrooms and the listed price is lower than what the model outputs, it may be the best option on the market. It could also act as an indicator for buyers to do their due diligence. There’s a chance that the house is listed below its supposed true value because there is something wrong with the house, i.e. poor foundation. The model acts as a professional in pricing whilst the buyer shops for houses, ultimately supporting them throughout the entire process.\n",

    "The limitations of the KNN model however, include an inability to see how much one factor affects the housing price. Had the linear regression model been a better predictor, we could have gained additional insight into what factors heavily influence the price, and used those insights to power buyers/sellers decisions. For example, if the number of bedrooms significantly increased the listing price, it could be worth it for a seller to repurpose an empty room into a bedroom. \n",

    "### Future Questions\n",
    "- Is it cheaper to buy a house with amenities included or buy one without and install yourself?\n",
    "- What other variables can impact a house(e.g. age of the house, color)?\n",
    "- While the study suggests a weaker impact of neighborhood characteristics, could specific neighborhood features or amenities in Vancouver exhibit a stronger correlation with housing prices compared to broader area analysis?\n",
