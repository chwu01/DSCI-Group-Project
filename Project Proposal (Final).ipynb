    "**Introduction**\n",
    "Housing prices are based on a variety of factors, and fluctuate with the health of the economy. However, there should always be things about a home that intrinsically make it higher value than others. Removing economic fluctuations, what makes a house worth more than another, and how can we predict the value of a house? \n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Goal:</ins> Predict housing prices based on a combination of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, we will be using a comprehensive dataset that includes various attributes of residential properties. The dataset will include information on property size, architectural features, the presence of amenities (such as parking or whether the house is near the mainroad), and infrastructures within the house. By analyzing these variables and comparing the non-economic factors, we aim to identify what variables have the greatest influence on price prediction, that can be used to predict house prices."

    "**Methods**\n",
    "Our base model will be a multivariate regression with our quantitative variables that are known to increase house value (area, bedrooms, bathroom, stories). It will involve a mixture of different types of plots, correlation analysis and regression model. We will be comparing the effect of other categorical variables (whether or not the house has a basement, heating, air conditioning, etc.) to identify the most relevant predictor variables that significantly affect housing prices. Then, we will use 1 to 2 categorical variables that best increase the accuracy of the model from the last step to predict the house prices. Once the model is complete, we will visualize the results with a scatterplot."
